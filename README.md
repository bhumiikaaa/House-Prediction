House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview:

This project implements a house price prediction model using Linear Regression in Python. The model is trained on a dataset containing various features of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and other relevant attributes, to predict the price of a house.

Features:

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables)

Data visualization for insights

Model training using Linear Regression

Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score

Predicting house prices based on input features



Technologies Used:


Python

Pandas (for data manipulation)

NumPy (for numerical operations)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning model implementation)


Installation:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git

cd house-price-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

Load the dataset and preprocess the data.

Train the Linear Regression model using the provided training script.

Evaluate the model on test data.

Use the model to predict house prices based on input features.

Run the main script:

python main.py

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project includes features like:

Number of bedrooms

Number of bathrooms

Square footage

Location

Year built

Other relevant attributes

Model Evaluation:

The performance of the model is measured using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared score

Results:
The model is able to predict house prices with reasonable accuracy, and the results are visualized using plots comparing actual vs. predicted prices.
